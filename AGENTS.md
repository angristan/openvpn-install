* Use gh CLI to interact with github
* Test locally using the docker setup when needed
* When doing changes, check if README/FAQ and tests needs to be updated
* Remember the script and documentation needs to be accessible to a moderately technical audience
* Keep PR description concise (no test plan)
* Don't use gh cli to post comments on the developer's behalf
* Don't amend commits and force push unless told otherwise
